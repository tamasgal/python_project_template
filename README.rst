A Python Project Template
=========================

Fork this project by clicking on the ``Fork`` button
(https://git.km3net.de/examples/python_project/forks/new) and afterwards
go to your project "settings/advanced" and click on
"Remove fork relationship".

Finally adjust the following files to your needs to get started with a
new Python project:

- ``requirements.txt`` - a list of Python packages needed for your software
- ``setup.py`` - this includes meta data for your package and is required
  for the ``pip install`` procedure. The most important things to change
  are listed at the top of the file.
- ``doc/conf.py`` - the documentation is configured in this file. Make sure
  to update the descriptions, title, ``import`` statements and so on.
  Add ``*.rst`` files inside the ``doc`` folder and include them in
  ``index.rst``. If you need more information, check out the Sphinx
  documentation.
- ``.gitlab-ci.yml`` - this file describes the stages and jobs you want to
  run on the KM3NeT continuous integration servers
- ``.coveragerc`` - contains a list of files to include or skip. Make sure
  to update the package name to match yours and exclude files which should
  not be tracked

Please note that the GitLab CI is using KM3NeT services (the GitLab runners and
the KM3NeT Docker registry), so make sure you update the settings to match
your environment.

Don't write me a mail, please create an issue

questions, feedback or feature requests. Merge requests are welcome!
